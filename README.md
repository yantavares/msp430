# MSP430

My MSP430 Coding Projects and Experiments (SIMIC - UnB)

**Note:** If this repository helped you, please leave a :star: on the repo :)

## Running

To run the projects, I recommend using Code Composer Studio (IDE made by Texas Instruments). You can download it from [TI's website](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO).

## Project Organization

Directories with the prefix `_Exp[n]` contain experiments from the Microprocessor Systems (SISMIC) course at the University of Bras√≠lia, while other directories contain personal projects and tests.

Each directory typically contains the source code, project files, and any relevant documentation or notes specific to the experiment or project.

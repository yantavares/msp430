# MSP430

My MSP430 Coding Projects and Experiments (SIMIC - UnB)

**Note:** If this repository helped you, please leave a :star: on the repo :)

## Running

To run the projects, I recommend using Code Composer Studio (IDE made by Texas Instruments). You can download it from [TI's website](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO).

## Project Organization

Each project is organized in a folder containing the exercises and a brief description of each one in the `README.md` file.
